Description: H.265/HEVC video stream encoder
 x265 is a commandline encoder for creating H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding
 (HEVC) video streams.
 .
 x265 supports the following features:
  * full prediction and transform quad-tree recursion supported
  * adaptive B-frame placement
  * B-frames as references / arbitrary frame order
  * CABAC (context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding) entropy coding
  * supports all Intra block types
  * supports all Inter P partitions
  * supports all Inter B partitions from 64x64 down to 8x4
  * weighted prediction for P slices
  * multiple reference frames
  * scenecut detection
  * parallel encoding on multiple CPUs
